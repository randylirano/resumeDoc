# ResumeDoc
A platform where students (both non-traditional and traditional alike) and folks looking to break into tech can create rich, compelling resumes in less than 10 minutes.


## Objective
This project is intended to focus on full-stack web development using React.js (frontend library), Node.js (backend development environment) and Express. The User Interface of this application was built using several modular React components. The database for the platform was built using a non-relational database called Mongo DB. The database was hosted using MongoDB Atlas as our database server.

## How-To-Use
There are 2 ways to use this project.
1. Visit our deployed application at Heroku. (link below)
2. Clone this git repository and run locally.

### Using locally via `git clone`
Once you clone our repository, make sure to install all dependencies.
Run the following command inside ResumeDoc root folder to install all dependencies: `yarn install`

At the `db` folder, we have provided 4 JSON files to be used as a collection for the database.
1. UI_UX_Resumes.json
2. SWE_Resumes.json
3. PM_Resumes.json
4. Users.json

#### Creating local database
Before running the program we first need to create a local database.
Run the following command in your terminal to start local mongo server: `mongod --dbpath ~/data/db`
Keeping the local server running, open a new terminal and run the following to create local resumeDocDB database and import the given JSON files as collections:

1. Create local DB via command line
```
mongoimport -h localhost:27017 -d resumeDoc -c Users --drop --jsonArray --file ./db/Users.json
mongoimport -h localhost:27017 -d resumeDoc -c SWE_Resumes --drop --jsonArray --file ./db/SWE_Resumes.json
mongoimport -h localhost:27017 -d resumeDoc -c UI_UX_Resumes --drop --jsonArray --file ./db/UI_UX_Resumes.json
mongoimport -h localhost:27017 -d resumeDoc -c PM_Resumes --drop --jsonArray --file ./db/PM_Resumes.json
```

2. Create MongoDBCompass
If you have the MongoDBCompass GUI, you could also use that to import the given JSON file as collections

NOTE: In the db folder make sure the global constant is saying `DB_NAME = "resumeDoc"`, otherwise the program cannot find the local database.

#### Running locally
Once the local database has been created, follow these steps to run locally:
1. Open a terminal session and run Mongo server: `mongod --dbpath ~/data/db`
2. Install the `node_modules` folder in the backend at ~/resumeDoc with the command `yarn install`
3. Run the command `yarn start` to start the node backend server at port 3001
4. Open a new terminal session and install the `node_modules` folder in the frontend at ~/resumeDoc/frontend with the command `yarn install`
5. Run the command `yarn start` to start the react development sever at port 3000
6. Using your browser go to localhost: http://locahost:3000/

<!-- Nathaniel's Code Review for Kennedy -->
<!-- I really like the simple and intuitive design and layout of your resumeDoc web application. The colors used in the Landing page work really well! -->
<!-- I also really like the simplicity and accessibility behind all your form components in your resumeDoc web application. It really gives you the feeling that you're
 building your resume (either as a SWE, PM or UI/UX designer) within a short period of time!-->
<!-- I really do like the alignment setup in your create resume page, but I will be honest if the alignment portion for the final project wasn't a grading requirement 
it would be nice to have the form fields for each section (Title, Education, Work Experience and etc.) grouped in a certain way. I feel like grouping the fields for each section would make it easier to browse through which sections would need to be filled up for creating your resume.
<!-- I also really like the use of colors and design on the Resume Dashboard for the different roles! -->
<!-- It would be best if you used an h2 element (and customizing the h2 element's font, colors and etc. in a certain way) instead of an h5 element for your landing page-->
<!-- Overall you did a really good job! I really like the intuitiveness of what resumeDoc is and how easy it is to use your application for building template structured 
resumes -->
